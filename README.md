# py-read

This is a small Python Script I wrote to get data from log files and output the wanted parts into a summary file. 

I have each batch of log files separated into different folders by date. The script first prompts for which folder is to be read:

"Which files are to be read? "

After selecting the folder it will go through the log files looking for the data that you are looking for.

# To Do

1. Make inital menu for listing information to look for
2. Clean up
